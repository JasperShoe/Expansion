To Do:
- Define things that are player tiles vs. map tiles, player tiles are just for keeping track of the player's tiles, and nothing else, where map tiles are every tiles/world tiles
- Player tiles shouldn't be removed/added when removing/adding tiles to the world, they are only an index
- Make map generate on client side from server (same tiles) [ ]
- Make gui for tile selection (building, attacking) [ ]
- Make gui for building [ ]
- Make all building classes [ ]
- Create unit classes and create fighting [ ]
- Make tower functions [ ]

Expansion:
- Real Time Strategy
- Medieval
- Tiles

Objective:
- Take over territory to gain resources and land
- Use resources to build structures on land
- Conquer the other players

Tiles:
- Each tile is a certain biome that provides different bonuses and tax amounts
    - Plain, food production bonus and low tax
    - Forest, wood production bonus and low tax
    - Hill, medium defense boost, medium attack boost, medium tax
    - Desert, no tax, no bonus, just land

Structures:
- Castle, position of power of each player
- Farm, produces food
- Lumber Mill, produces wood
- Barrack, trains troops using resources
- Tower, protects tiles in its range
- NPC Village, low defense boost, medium tax, resource rewards upon invading, medium defense
- NPC City, high defense boost, high tax, a lot of resource rewards upon invading, high defense
- NPC Tower, high defense to attack, no tax, no rewards, free tower

Troops:
- Move troops tile to tile
- If troops bump into enemies or are commanded to attack other tiles, attack
- Troop quantity and type affect battle
    - Archers
    - Cavalry
    - Warriors
    - Archers > Cavalry > Warriors > Archers
- Troops can be moved into structures
    - Archers into towers for increase in defense
    - Cavalry into farms for increase in food production
    - Warriors into lumber mills for increase in wood production
- Troops cost food, wood, and gold (gold is accumulated through tax of each owned tile)

Notes:
- Gold should be very desired in order for players to want to get more land
    - Research/Upgrades? <- YES DEFINITELY SHOULD HAVE RESEARCH AND BUILDING UPGRADES
